I'm Danielle Graves Williamson, a 6th year Economics PhD student at Boston University. I study how policies and institutions have shaped access to opportunity. My job market paper focuses on quantifying the legacy of the all-white private schools that emerged in 20th century as part of a broader strategy to block school integration. 

I am a 2025 NAED/Spencer Dissertation Fellow. You can read a write-up of my dissertation [here](https://naeducation.org/awardee/danielle-graves-williamson/). 

I served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers 2024, where I focused on issues related to education, childcare, and health.

I am on the 2025-2026 job market. You can reach me at <dcgw@bu.edu>.
