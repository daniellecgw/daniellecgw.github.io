#### Office Hours
I encourage you to come to office hours! 

Office hours are held **in person** every Tuesday from 10:30 - 12:00pm and Friday from 9:00-11:00am at the Clover in the Science Center. Make an appointment below, or walk-in. Students with appointments will be prioritized. If I have to make a change to my normally scheduled office hours, I'll let you know in advance.

If you can't make my in person office hours, I hold office hours by Zoom on Wednesdays **by appointment only**. E-mail me for the appointment link.
