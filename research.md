### The Effects of Preserving Segregation: Evidence from All-White Private Schools
<details>
  <summary>(with Michael Holcomb)</summary>
  <p>
  Institutionalized backlash may be an important mediator of social progress. In the post-Brown v. Board (1954) U.S. South, white citizens established de jure segregationist private schools. These “segregation academies” effectively impeded efforts to integrate schools, especially in rural areas (Williamson, 2024).

  <p>
  In this paper, we study the consequences of this preservation of segregation on historical voting behavior and later racial attitudes in the Southeast. We argue that segregation academies entrenched a culture of racial division in places that otherwise would have made steps toward integration. Using difference-in-differences designs around the openings of segregation academies, we find a shift in anti-Black racial attitudes in White respondents in treated counties and a decline in local Black political representation. We discuss potential explanations for these patterns and extensions for future work.
