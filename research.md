Throughout my work, I focus on how the provision of public goods is shaped by backlash to social and demographic shifts.

##### How Backlash in Schools Shaped the Political Evolution of People and Places: Evidence from All-White Private Schools
<details>
  <summary>*(with Michael Holcomb)*</summary>
  <p>
  Institutionalized backlash may be an important mediator of social progress. In the post-Brown v. Board (1954) U.S. South, white citizens established de jure segregationist private schools. These “segregation academies” effectively impeded efforts to integrate schools, especially in rural areas (Williamson, 2025).

  In this paper, we study the consequences of this preservation of segregation on historical voting behavior and later racial attitudes in the Southeast. We argue that segregation academies entrenched a culture of racial division in places that otherwise would have made steps toward integration. Using difference-in-differences designs around the openings of segregation academies, we find a shift in anti-Black racial attitudes in White respondents in treated counties and a decline in local Black political representation. We discuss potential explanations for these patterns and extensions for future work.

##### Divorce and Retirement 

<details>
  <summary> *(with Rachel Vogt)* </summary>
  <p>
  Existing policy encourages married couples to engage in joint-decision making when allocating time among income-earning, household, and leisure activities. Often, it is more eﬃcient for one partner to specialize in household tasks, while the other specializes in earning. Disproportionately, women in heterosexual couples fall into the former camp, taking on the role of secondary earners and engaging in part-time work more often than their male counterparts. 
  This secondary earner status disadvantages divorced women. A feature of the Social Security system tries to insure against this: the spousal benefit. How effective is this policy? We use a regression discontinuity design that exploits the discontinuous feature of the spousal benefit: eligibility is contingent on the marriage lasting must be at least 10 years. Previous research, confirmed by our own preliminary analyses, shows no evidence of manipulation behavior around the cutoff. We thus can compare women around the cutoff to measure the impact of the spousal benefit on financial and mental well-being.

## Policy Writing

As a staff economist on the Council of Economic Advisers, I contributed to internal and external policy memos and briefs on topics including (but not limited to) health insurance and markets, child care, social insurance, and higher education financing. Notable examples are linked below.
