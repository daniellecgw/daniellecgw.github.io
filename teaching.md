## Courses

[The Evolution of Segregation and Education](https://daniellecgw.github.io/teaching/segregation-ed)

> Danielle was a great preceptor for Econ 970! She was very knowledgeable about this topic and did a great job at introducing us to
all of the relevant literature. **She was very accessible,** and returned all assignments in a timely fashion. She gave me great feedback
at every step of the way and was happy to help me during the process of putting together my own research paper. I appreciate all the
advice that she gave us to succeed in the course, and I think she did a great job of covering both breadth and depth within the
complex topic of the evolution of segregation in education. It was a pleasure to be enrolled in this section. **It was a very challenging
course, but also a very rewarding one.** 

> WOW. Danielle Graves is hands–down one of the top instructors in my economics degree ... Harvard is full of published professors who are fantastic at producing and presenting research,
but it takes a special kind of skillset to be able to conduct this research and yet also teach the process effectively to students.
Danielle does both extraordinarily well. She presented us with a wealth of high–level literature, which initially struck me as
unfamiliar and overwhelming–– but, she efficiently leveraged class time and response paper assignments (which are really great
for helping me absorb the key takeaways of a research publication) to make each paper accessible, interesting, and beyond that, in
conversation with other literature. **She held us to high standards and graded fairly,** but offered generous support and flexibility in her
office hours to help each student with their empirical research skills. Personally, I had a tough semester with academic and
personal challenges which would sometimes affect my performance or attendance in our seminar–– **Danielle was so
accommodating and supportive while still expecting (and encouraging) a high work ethic from me. I found that my understanding of
empirical economics improved significantly, as well as my general confidence and clarity in economic writing.** I am not exaggerating
when I say that this seminar and **Danielle's mentorship restored my faith in my economics degree,** and inspired me to keep
pushing forward to find my niche and own my progress in something which was previously difficult and frustrating at times. I am
genuinely so grateful to have taken her course, and wish her all the best in her future ...
